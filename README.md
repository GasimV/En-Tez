# Intent Recognition for Document Retrieval

## Project Description
This project aims to build an intent recognition system to assist citizens applying to a government agency to receive specific types of documents through an automatic machine with a built-in voice assistant. The model recognizes the intentions of citizens based on their spoken requests and determines the type of document they intend to receive.
Features

- Built using a dataset in the Azerbaijani language.
- Utilizes classical Machine Learning models like KNN and Multinomial Naive Bayes.
- Employs multiple evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Integrates with voice assistants to provide a seamless user experience.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of text samples and their corresponding intents. The main intent labels include:

- Registration of a newborn
- Death registration
- Inquiry about family composition
- Inquiry about family status

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib
